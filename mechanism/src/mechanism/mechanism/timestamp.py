"""The `timestamp` tool — temporal grounding for UserPromptSubmit.

Minimal prototype: returns the Claude Code hook output schema with a
one-line "was sent at" `additionalContext`. No Redis dependence, no
"elapsed since previous message" clause — those come back when this
shape is validated.

Returns a plain dict, not a primitive string or a Pydantic model.
FastMCP wraps primitive returns in `{"result": ...}` structured content,
which Claude Code's hook layer doesn't recognize. Pydantic models with
`serialization_alias` need `by_alias=True` at dump time, which FastMCP
doesn't promise. A plain dict with string-literal camelCase keys passes
through FastMCP cleanly: the keys are clearly Claude-Code's schema, not
our Python convention.
