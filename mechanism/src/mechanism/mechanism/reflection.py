"""The `reflection` tool — Stop hook, sometimes-fires reflection reminder.

Port of the `/hooks/reflection` HTTP handler to an MCP tool on the
mechanism server. Stop hooks have a different envelope from
UserPromptSubmit hooks: they don't use ``additionalContext``; instead
they return ``{"decision": "block", "reason": <text>}`` to prevent the
turn from ending and feed ``reason`` to the model as the instruction to
continue. A firing reflection hook *both* keeps the conversation going
AND surfaces the reminder text in-band.

Fires on turns 1, 4, 7, 10, ... — every third turn starting at 1. Turn
count is per-session, stored in Redis, with a 7-day TTL.

Hook input includes ``stop_hook_active`` (true when Claude Code is
already continuing because of a prior Stop block). Must NOT re-block in
that case — Claude Code overrides after 8 consecutive blocks, but we
shouldn't lean on the safety net. The hook config wires this in via
``${stop_hook_active}`` substitution.

Returns ``None`` (empty response) on no-fire or when stop_hook_active is
true; returns the block-decision dict on fire.
