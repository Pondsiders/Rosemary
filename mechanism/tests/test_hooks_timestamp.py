"""Integration test for `POST /hooks/timestamp`.

Returns an `additionalContext` string saying when the user sent the message.
On the first call for a session, that's all it says. On subsequent calls,
the context is extended with a "since the previous message" gap clause.

The brittle assertion pins the *behavior* (gap clause appended on the second
call) without pinning the *wording* — if we ever change the exact text of
either clause this test still passes; if we ever stop emitting the gap
clause on subsequent calls, this test breaks.
