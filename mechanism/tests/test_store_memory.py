"""Integration test for the `store_memory` MCP tool.

End-to-end via FastMCP's in-process client against the test stack. Asserts
that store_memory inserts a row in cortex.memories with the content we sent
and a non-null embedding.

In local dev this hits real Bifrost for the embedding call (which is the
intended design — see #10 conversation: real upstream in local, mocked in
CI). The LLM-mock fixture for CI is a separate piece of work.

Japanese content per the fluorescent-dye seed plan.
